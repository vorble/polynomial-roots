# TODO

* I'm unsure of my implementation in
  [quadratic_root_cycle_solver.py](/quadratic_root_cycle_solver.py)
  and whether it is finding the correct solutions.
  - I should double check my approach and whether using the inverse of root
    finding in this way is valid.
    - In my analysis of cycle length 2, I don't find the roots via the cycle
      generating root finding method (ordering the roots in a particular way),
      which may be causing an issue.
  - I should add a verification step that eliminates erroneous solutions.
